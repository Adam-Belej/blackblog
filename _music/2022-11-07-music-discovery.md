## Internet sources
This is list of my favorite places on the internet for discovering new interesting artists.

### Best sources
 - **[Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)** - my personal favorite site for music publishing.
    It has great user interface, artists has a lot of ways to communicate with fans
    and most importantly you can by and download music as file. I wish this would be the
    standard in music streaming services.
 - **[Bandzone](https://bandzone.cz/)** - Really good place for discovering Czech artists.
    It is probably best place too look for undergroud shows.
 - **[Obscure](https://obscure.cz/)** - Best ticket selling service in Czechia. They
    are focused on heavy and alternative music, which are the best ones.

### Bad sources
- **[Youtube]()** - Untransparent a unfair recommendations, search and monetizations. Strong censorship
   full of double standards. Actively fights downloading content.
- **[Spotify]()** - Same things as youtube and behind paywall. Only contains mainstream artists.
