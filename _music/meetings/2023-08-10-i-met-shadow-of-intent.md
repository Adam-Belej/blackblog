When I find there is a chance to meet with Shadow of intent, it was no-brainer.

I really enjoyed contrast of them on stage on off the stage.
On stage their are deathcore machines. Off stage their are just childish dudes trying to have fun.

For example some dude asked them to sign his butt and they did not hesitate.
