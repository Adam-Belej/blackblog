Peter Tägtgren is musical genius responsible for multiple great projects.
For example Lindemann, Pain and Hypocrisy. This dude is next level.

I had honor to see him perform on Lindemann tour in 2019 and this time with his band Hypocrisy.

I asked a lady from security if she would take a picture with me and the band.
I did not checked the photos and left. Now I am at home face palming.

This lady took just a picture of me and Peter. No other members of the band are in the photo.
I am kinda sad but it is already done. Next time I explicitly ask for whole band photo.
