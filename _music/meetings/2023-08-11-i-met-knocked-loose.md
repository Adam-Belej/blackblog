I never really listened to Knocked loose much.
I always knew about their existence but never gave them a chance.
But it all changed when they released [Upon Loss singles](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=H4KYH7LK2_0).

This double track totally brought me to my knees. Hard slapping riffs mixed with eerie dissonance.
Vocals so angry that they are perfectly capturing "the core" feel I loved so much as a teenager.

I was really looking forward to see them live and to my luck they were going to play on Brutal Assault 2023.

The pit was so wild. Thank you guys for the show.
