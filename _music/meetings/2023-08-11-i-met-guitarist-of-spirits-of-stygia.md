After the performance of band Knocked loose, I was absolutely devastated.
Their sound was heavy as the sun, so moshpit was accordingly hardcore too.

After their performance, I went to [meet and greet](/music/i-met-knocked-loose-2023-08-11/) to thank the band for a great time they brought with them.
While waiting for the band members to come, I met there a friendly Slovenian dude.
We started to chat with each other and he revealed to me that he is the guitarist in the band [Spirits of Stygia](https://spiritsofstygia.bandcamp.com/).
I wrote that band name to my notes to check them out later.

Now nearly 3 weeks later after we have met I finally checked them out and damnâ€¦ **they are excellent!**

They have recently released a single [Graveyard of thoughts](https://spiritsofstygia.bandcamp.com/track/graveyard-of-thoughts) with a [ music video](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=8ukCxlx-smU).
You should definitely check them out. I love this single so much that I have already [bought it on bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/yagarea).
