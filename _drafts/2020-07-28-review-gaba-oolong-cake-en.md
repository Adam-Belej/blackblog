Until now, I have been using a camera built into my phone to document tea for reviews. But this tea forced me to use the SLR, because the contrast of dark leaves on a white background was too much for my poor iPhone to handle. The photos had a broken exposure and were unusable. <a href="/tea/gaba-oolong-cake/cake-unused.jpg"> See for yourself. </a> The SLR has worked for me, so I decided to make future reviews with it. This complication is also the reason why the disc in the photo below is already broken.
