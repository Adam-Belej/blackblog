EyeDryLeaf: "The diameter of the circle is 13 cm, the disc is 1 cm high and weights 100 g. The leafs are laid parallelly to each other. They have various shades of green and seem to be similar to the pattern 95 used by the Czech army. The pieces of long brown twigs will surely catch your attention. The disc is very hard and the light trash crumbles from it."
EyeWetLeaf: "The twig pieces darkened. The leafes are tattered from breaking off of the disc. The amount of the trash increased, it has absorbed some of the water and adhered to the inside parts of the tea pod."
EyeLiquor: "If you look at this tea for the first time, you might think it is an apple juice. But if you look at it closely, you will find out that it contains small particles that come from the leafs. Even though you can't see the particles with your naked eye, they don't disturb you when drinking the tea. With the increasing number of the brews the colour turns into green with golden shadows."
