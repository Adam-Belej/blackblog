## Introduction
**What is AI ?**

> Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines do things that would
> require intelligence if done by men.
>
> - Marvin Minsky, 1967

> Artificial intelligence attempts to build intelligent entities.

### Logic
**What is rational reasoning ?**
- Aristotle (384-322 B.C.): laws of rational thinking
	- Syllogism: generate conclusions mechanically - Patters for argument structures that always yield correct conclusions when given correct premises
- René Descartes (1596 - 1650): advance power of reasoning in understanding the world
- George Boole (1815 - 1864): formal logic

### Probability
**What if things are not black or white ?**
- Dealing with uncertain measurements and incomplete theories
- Gerolano Cardano (1501 - 1576): possible outcomes of gambling events
- Thomas Bayes ()////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

### Economics
**How to do my decisions to maximize payoff?**
- Adam Smith (1723 - 1790): economics as a science (economies consist of individual agents maximizing their own economic well-doing)
- Economics - study of how people make choices that lead to preferred outcomes
- Utility theory - how to make decisions under uncertaintly affect utility of other agents
	- John von Neumann, Oskar Morgenstern - The theory of Games and economic behavior (1944)
- Operations research: decisions where payoffs are not immediete but result from a sequence of actions
	- ///////////////////////////////////

### Automatizations
**How to design information processing machines?**  
- Automaton - Antikythera mechanism
- Josef Marie Jacquard (1752 - 1834) - first programmable machine (punched cards store instructions for the pattern of woven)
- Charles Babbage (1792-1871) 
	- Difference Engine (compute mathematical tables)
	- Analytical engine (universal computation)
- Konrad Zuse - Z-3, first programmable computer (1941)
- Alan Turing - Colossus (1943)

## Artificial inteligence
Two-month workshop at Dartmouth Collage. 
- John McCarthy: name Artificial Intelligence (computational rationality would be better)
- Allen Newell, Herbert Simon: Logic theorist (program can prove theorems from Principia Mathematica)

Why AI (and not control theory/cybernetics)?
- duplicating human faculties like creativity, self-improvement, and language use
- branch of computer science
- build machines that functions /////////////////////////////////////

Demonstrating one ox C after another from the list "a machine can never do X"
- Newell and Simon: General problem solver - imitate human problem solving
- Herbert Gelerneter (1959): Geometry Theorem prover
- John McCarthy (1958) - AI programming language **Lisp**
- Solving **micro worlds**: limited problems that appear to require intelligence to solve
	- Tom Evans (1968): Analogy (problems from IQ tests)
	- Daniel Bobrow (1967): Student (algebra story problems)
	- Terry Winograd (1872): **blockworld** - manipulationg a set of solid blocks placed on a tabletop
	- David Waltz (1975): constraint propagation in computer vision
	- Frank Rosenblatt (1962): perceptron - learning algorithm to adjust connection strengths to match any input data
