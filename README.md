## About me
I am a Czech highschool student. My interests are software development, Mathematics, Theology and Philosophy. I am also huge tea enthusiastic. In my free time I try to write lyrical stuff, but I am not self-confident enought to publish anything yet. I also love to attend metal or hardcore concerts, ski and travel.
